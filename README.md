# Math for Programmers Sandbox

Working through chapters and excecises in [Math for Programmers](https://www.manning.com/books/math-for-programmers?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=dynamicremarketing&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_Lb1466v6AIVkkZeCh1HuwuNEAEYASACEgLgkvD_BwE)

The programs in this book are in Python and I using it to learn how mostly practice with Clojure(Script), Clojure Helix, HTML Graphic(Canvas & SVG) and also learn some more Math :)
